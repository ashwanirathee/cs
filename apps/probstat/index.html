        Let's start a discussion on probability and statistics. Currently there are 7 people in a house with 4 rooms where 3 rooms has 2 beds and 1 room has 1 bed only.
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What are number of ways that people can be distributed in the rooms?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given there are 7 people and 4 rooms:
                    <ul>
                        <li> </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
